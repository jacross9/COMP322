        <h1>Jeremy Cross</h1>
        <h2>Short Biography</h2>
            <p>My name is Jeremy Cross. I am a senior Computer Science student at North Carolina A&T State University.
                As a student, I am currently a cyber-security/data analytics intern for the Internal Revenue Service based out of Washington, D.C.
                I plan to use the skills gained from being a student, an avid golfer, and cyber-security professional to
                uplift and encourage minority youth to pursue a S.T.E.M. education (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics)
                and advocate for junior golf teams in underserved neighborhoods and areas.
            </p>
