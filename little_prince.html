                As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.
                <span class="underlined">I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</span>
                <span class="highlighted">It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</span>
                In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:
                <span class="boldredtext">"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible..."</span></br>
                As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again:
                <span class="boldredtext"> What moves me so deeply about this little prince who is sleeping here,
                    is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame
                    of a lamp, even when he is asleep..."
                </span> And I felt </br> him to be more fragile still.
                <span class="underlined">I felt the need of </br> protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...</span>
